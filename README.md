# SimpleChat
A simple chat program created as a collaboration between myself and Sam.

To host:

1. Run ServerApplication.exe.
2. Run command prompt and type 'ipconfig' without quotes.
3. Look for a field that looks like 'IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . :'.
4. Note down this value, this will be needed by the clients to connect.

To connect:

1. Open ClientApplication.exe.
2. Enter the IP value from the host.
3. Press enter to use the default port.
4. Chat!
5. Type 'q' without quotes and press enter to quit.
